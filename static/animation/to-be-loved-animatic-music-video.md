Ideals of beauty have been around for a long time. The pressure to meet artificial perfection keeps increasing, which secretly also takes its toll on the pretty pictures themselves. In this unofficial animatic music video for Bent - To Be Loved, we follow the story of an insecure fashion-illustration with a knack for melodrama, who is obsessed with her flawless idol.

This is my graduation film of 2020, for AKV|St. Joost. With this video I want to spread a message of self-acceptance and awareness about unattainable beauty standards.
