**Sexism** in the media is nothing new. On the daily we are confronted by imagery in which scantily clad women are used as decoration, or worse: they are reduced to **sexual objects** to sell a product. There are already campaigns against this issue. That’s why I wanted to focus on a specific aspect of objectification, namely **self-objectification**. This condition mainly arose after the emergence of the social media. It means that women continuously scrutinize their appearance, compare themselves to others and view themselves **through the eye of the other**. This appearance anxiety is often the cause for depression, sexual disorders and eating disorders.

With this animation I want to make the public aware of this problem and **change the general mentality**. When you look at a self-objectiying person, don’t think “what an attention-seeker” (we all love attention) but have compassion for **the person behind the picture**.
