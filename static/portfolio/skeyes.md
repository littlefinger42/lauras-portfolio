_For this piece of animation I was inspired by the works of **James Turrell.** His **introspective**_ _approach to concepts like **‘light’** and **‘the sky’**_ _speaks to me directly. In order to convey the same feeling, the animation needed to be from a **first-person view.** I enjoyed experimenting with the combination of  traditional animation and video footage, and telling a more **abstract narrative.** This animation was part of an exposition celebrating the 25th anniversary of museum De Pont in Tilburg, The Netherlands._
