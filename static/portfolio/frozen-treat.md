This is an animation based on the book **“The Ice-cream Makers”** by Ernest van der Kwast, made for the exposition “Boek in Beeld” in collaboration with de Verkadefabriek. I was most inspired by the relationship between **the main character’s brother Luca and his wife Sophia.** They run a succesful icecream parlor together, but when Luca becomes obsessed with his job, **their love begins to grow ice-cold...** I wanted to experiment with sound, using different instruments for the main characters as parts of a main track when they’re working **‘in tune’.**
