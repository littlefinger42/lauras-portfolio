**The swan and the raven are not what they seem**. Swans stand for **gracefulness**, their white feathers with **purity and innocence**. But swans can be quite aggressive. The raven on the other hand, often indicates **death and evil**, while they are very intelligent and mostly social. Here I played with our preconceived notion of **what is good and what is bad**.

I was given a word (anger), a soundclip (birds in trees) and a picture (some sort of glove with tiny gloves on the fingertips) to draw inspiration from for this project. This is what I came up with.
